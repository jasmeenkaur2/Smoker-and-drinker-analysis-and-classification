Drinking and smoking can have detrimental effects on the human body. Smoking
is a leading cause of lung cancer, respiratory issues, and heart disease, while
excessive alcohol consumption can damage the liver, increase the risk of certain
cancers, and lead to addiction. Both habits can have a negative impact on mental
health and may contribute to various chronic health conditions. It's crucial to
understand these risks and make informed choices to safeguard your well-being.
Introducing a comprehensive prediction system for the effects of smoking and
drinking on the human body, this innovative tool utilizes vast data and scientific
research to forecast the potential impacts on various bodily systems. By
incorporating information on individual habits, frequency, and duration of smoking
and drinking, this system employs predictive algorithms to anticipate the potential
consequences on health.
By leveraging machine learning models and predictive analytics, the system offers
users an insight into their potential health trajectory, encouraging informed
decisions and proactive measures to mitigate health risks associated with smoking
and drinking.
Smoking and drinking dataset with body signal is used for this prediction system,
which is publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset contains 24 features that give
personâ€™s information.
